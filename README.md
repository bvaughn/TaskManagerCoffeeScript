## Installation Instructions

To build this project from source you'll need both [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [CoffeeScript-concat](https://github.com/fairfieldt/coffeescript-concat) installed and in your $PATH.

Then you can build by running ```ruby build.rb``` from within the **build** directory.

To generate documentation for the projects you will need to install [Codo](https://github.com/netzpirat/codo). Once codo has been installed, documentation can be generated by running ```codo ./source/*.coffee``` from within the **root** directory of the project.
